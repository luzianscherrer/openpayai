        One winter evening, a poor farmer was walking home through the snow when
        he found a crane caught in a hunter’s trap. Its wings beat weakly,
        feathers marked with ice. The farmer felt pity and freed the bird,
        watching it fly into the white sky.

        That night, a knock came at his door. A young woman stood shivering,
        asking for shelter. The farmer and his wife welcomed her, and soon she
        became like a daughter to them.

        One day she said, “Please, let me weave cloth for you. But I beg you—do
        not look into the room while I work.” They agreed, and she shut herself
        inside. After three days, she emerged with the most dazzling cloth they
        had ever seen, shimmering like snow in moonlight. Merchants paid dearly
        for it, and the household had food again.

        She wove more, each time returning pale and thin. Curiosity gnawed at
        the farmer, and at last he peeked through a crack in the door. To his
        shock, he saw not a girl but a crane, plucking her own feathers to weave
        into the shining cloth.
      </p>

        Knowing the truth was discovered, the young woman appeared once more in
        her crane form. “I am the bird you saved,” she said. “I wished to repay
        your kindness. But now that you have seen me, I cannot stay.” She spread
        her wings, rose into the sky, and vanished into the falling snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The farmer never saw her again, but whenever cranes flew overhead, he
        bowed in gratitude, remembering the gift of her woven light.
