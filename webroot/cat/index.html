      <p>
        Long ago in Edo, an antiques dealer roamed the streets in search of
        hidden treasures. He was known for his sharp eyes, spotting valuable
        pieces where others saw only junk.
      </p>

      <p>
        One afternoon, weary from his search, he stopped at a teahouse. Three
        cats were eating scraps of fish from a rough wooden floor. Yet what
        caught his attention was not the cats, but the small bowl they ate from.
        Though chipped and dirty, it was unmistakably an antique that could
        fetch a fortune.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dealer smiled and struck up conversation with the owner of the
        stall. Pretending to admire the animals, he asked, “Would you sell me
        one of these cats? I will give you three gold coins.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The stall keeper laughed at the strange request, but agreed. Cats were
        common, and three coins was generous. The dealer paid and scooped up the
        animal, stroking it fondly.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he prepared to leave, he reached down and lifted the cracked bowl.
        “Of course,” he said, “I will take its dish as well. The poor creature
        will not eat from another.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The stall keeper stopped him at once. “That bowl is no ordinary dish. I
        cannot part with it. In truth, it is worth hundreds of gold coins.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The dealer widened his eyes in feigned surprise. “If you know its value,
        why feed your cats with it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        With a wry smile, the stall keeper replied, “Because with that bowl, I
        often sell an ordinary cat for three gold coins.”
